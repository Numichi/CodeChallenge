**Lesson #1 (Iterations)** 
- **BinaryGap**: Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.

**Lesson #2 (Arrays)** 
- **CyclicRotation**: Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.
- **OddOccurrencesInArray**: Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.

**Lesson #3 (Time Complexity)** 
- **FrogJmp**: Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.
- **PermMissingElem**: Find the missing element in a given permuta
- **TapeEquilibrium**: Minimize the value `|(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|`.

**Lesson #4 (Counting Elements)** 
- **FrogRiverOne**: Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river.
- **MissingInteger**: Find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in a given sequence.
- **PermCheck**: Check whether array A is a permutation.
- **MaxCounters**: Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum.
